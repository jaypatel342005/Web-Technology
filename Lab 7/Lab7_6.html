<!-- Explanation:
In this task, we are demonstrating the concept of Array and Object Destructuring in JavaScript. We create an Array and an Object, and then use Array Destructuring to extract and display the first and last elements of the Array, and the first and last keys of the Object. We also combine both Array and Object Destructuring in one statement, and display the combined result in the console.log statement. The code is tested in a browser console, and
